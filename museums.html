	<h4>The New Jersey State Museum was the first state museum in the country established with education as a primary focus of its mission. The New Jersey Legislature formally established the museum by law in 1895, and the museum was housed in the New Jersey State House.
	The museum's collections include natural history specimens, archaeological and ethnographic artifacts, and cultural history and fine art objects, and exhibitions, educational programs and research provide context for the collections. The museum, which is a division of the New Jersey Department of State, 
	includes a 140-seat planetarium and a 384-seat auditorium. The collection includes 2+ million specimens.The Bureau of Archaeology/Ethnography collections encompass approximately 2.4 million prehistoric and historic specimens acquired by nearly 100 years of excavation, as well as almost 4,000 ethnographic objects 
	acquired as gifts to the museum. Scholars widely recognize the museum's archaeology specimens as the definitive systematic research collection for the study of the prehistory of New Jersey. Notably, the archaeological collection includes material excavated from the nearby Abbott Farm National Historic Landmark Site. 
	The museum's archaeology collections are respected as one of the most important collections for the regional study of northeastern North America, and provide data on the entire span of human occupation in New Jersey from prehistoric times to the 20th century.
	The Bureau of Cultural History preserves and interprets historical objects that document the lives of people who have lived in New Jersey from the 17th century to the present. The collection includes over 13,000 artifacts documenting New Jersey's cultural, economic, military, political, and social history, as well as 
	aspects of its decorative arts. Ranging from ceramics produced by Trenton potteries to decorative quilts made and used by New Jersey women to utilitarian artifacts reflecting the rich maritime and agricultural heritage of the Garden State, the Cultural History Collection is one of the largest material culture collections dealing with New Jersey history.
	The State Museum has collected over 12,000 works of art including paintings, prints, drawings, sculpture and photographs, most acquired since 1965 when the museum's mission was expanded to include fine art.
	The collection has an American focus that highlights the work of New Jersey artists within the context of American art history. Also included are works that depict New Jersey scenes and events.
	The Bureau of Natural History holds a diverse collection of about 250,000 specimens which have historic and cultural significance, in addition to their scientific value. The natural history collections are especially strong in industrial minerals and ores, paleontology specimens (fossils), osteology specimens (bones), modern shells, and a systematic study skin component. 
	Smaller sub-collections include pinned insects, fluid-preserved fauna, taxidermy mounts and glass lantern slides.
	The museum's Bureau of Education offers programs and events designed to offer activities that not only engage our audiences but help to instill a desire for lifelong object-based learning. School groups can attend museum-based classes, hands-on workshops, exhibition tours, planetarium programs, as well as access classroom resources such as curriculum guides.
	The museum's planetarium is equipped with “Full Dome” video technology, and also includes a digital video hemisphere as part of the planetarium lobby exhibitions. The 140-seat planetarium also features a Minolta MS-10 instrument for sky shows and visual displays of the solar system.
	Thismuseum is absolutely huge and and represents New Jersey's many diferent aspects such as the history, culture, traditions and arts.

	<h4>The Sterling Hill Mine, now known as the Sterling Hill Mine Tour & Museum of Fluorescence, is a former iron and zinc mine in Ogdensburg, Sussex County, New Jersey.
	It was the last working underground mine in New Jersey when it closed in 1986 and it became a museum in 1989. The mine along side the Franklin Mine is known for its variety of minerals, especially the fluorescent varieties.
	Due to it's historic importance the mine was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.
	The mine is very old as mining began at the site in the 1630s, when it was mistakenly thought to be a copper deposit.
	The mine remained active until 1986 when it closed due to a tax dispute with the town. The mine was important because In the area of the Franklin and Sterling Hill mines, 357 types of minerals are known to occur; these make up 
	approximately 10% of the minerals known to science. Thirty-five of these minerals have not been found anywhere else. Ninety-one of the minerals fluoresce.
	The tour spends about 30 minutes inside the Exhibit hall which contains a wide variety of mining memorabilia, mineralogical samples, fossils, and meteorites. It then leads into the mine for a 1,300 feet walk on level ground 
	through the underground mine. The walk goes through a new 240 feet section called the Rainbow tunnel which they blasted in 1990 using 49 blasts and at a cost of $2 a foot. In the Rainbow room, short wave UV lights 
	are turned on to demonstrate the entire tunnel and various samples glowing with fluorescence. This mine shows how important the land in New Jersey is and if you are interested in the industrial history of the state this mine wont disappoint.<br/>
