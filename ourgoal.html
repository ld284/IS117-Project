	<h4>New Jersey is one of the oldest states in America, with a lot of interesting history, <br/>traditions, culture, and art.
	Unfortunately though the state is often overlooked by<br/> Americans and foreign visitors alike. We aim to change that, we want to inform<br/>
	those people who are visiting New Jersey or that live in New Jersey about the history<br/> of the state. The most effective way to do this of course is by promoting the best<br/>
	museums in New Jersey. Museums naturaly offer a comprehensive guide to<br/> understanding the history of a place, thus we think they are the best option in order<br/> to infrom people about New Jersey.
	We offer a diverse list of the best museums in<br/> New Jersey that cover the many different aspects of the state, such as history, arts,<br/> science, archeology etc.
	On this website you will find a list with the best museums <br/>in the state with a description which will include the museum's history, the exhibits,<br/> and some of it's best attractions.
	This will make it easier for you to know what the<br/> museum has to offer beforehand and whether or not you wish to visit the museum.<br/>
	We  definitely want you and many other people to go and visit these amazing museums, <br/>thus we have also included a list with some convenient information about the museums<br/> such as 
	the exact address, the operating hours, and the price of admission. We hope this <br/>website will convince you and make it easier for you to visit these museums and learn <br/>more about the great state of New Jersey.
